# SQL-Radio-Station-CD-Organization
This project is a Relational Database Management System (DBMS) designed to organize a university radio station’s extensive music collection using MySQL. By implementing a normalized schema with 1:many relationships between music labels, CDs, and individual tracks, the database ensures referential integrity and eliminates data redundancy. The system features a series of advanced SQL queries to automate administrative tasks, such as generating sorted playlists by track length, calculating total CD playing time, and performing demographic analysis of music labels by nation. Built to solve the real-world challenge of music retrieval, this database transforms raw data into a structured tool for efficient radio programming and collection oversight.
