# SQL-Radio-Station-CD-Organization
This project is a Relational Database Management System (DBMS) designed to organize a university radio station’s extensive music collection using MySQL. By implementing a normalized schema with 1:many relationships between music labels, CDs, and individual tracks, the database ensures referential integrity and eliminates data redundancy. The system features a series of advanced SQL queries to automate administrative tasks, such as generating sorted playlists by track length, calculating total CD playing time, and performing demographic analysis of music labels by nation. Built to solve the real-world challenge of music retrieval, this database transforms raw data into a structured tool for efficient radio programming and collection oversight.

The project also includes advanced extension of the initial music collection database, transitioning from a simple relational model to a highly detailed system capable of managing complex many-to-many (M:M) relationships. By introducing associative entities such as person_recording, person_composition, and person_cd, the schema now tracks specific creative roles—including musicians, engineers, and composers—and links them directly to individual recordings and tracks. The upgraded MySQL implementation facilitates deep-data retrieval, allowing for granular inquiries such as identifying specific instrumentalists for a unique recording session or listing composers proficient in specific instruments. This iteration demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of database normalization and the technical ability to execute complex multi-table joins to provide comprehensive metadata for any musical work.
